Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) regulate gene expression transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, however, the expression of specific biotypes and their dynamics during preimplantation development remains to be determined. Using Small-seq, we identified the abundance of and dynamic expression of piRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, and miRNA in human embryos from day 3 to 7. Among the biotypes, both miRNA and snoRNA displayed distinct associations with developmental time and lineage formation, many of which were  found to target key gene expression programs in pluripotency and lineage establishment. We observed an enrichment of the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC) in the trophectoderm (TE), and the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (C14MC) and MEG8-related snoRNAs in the inner cell mass (ICM).

       " 'A robust circulating microRNA signature for diagnosis and early detection in pancreatobiliary cancer\\nPurpose: Oncologists for pancreatobiliary cancer (PBca) demand a new circulating biomarker superior to carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). This study aimed to identify the serum microRNA signature composed of reproducible and disease-related microRNAs with clinical bioinformatics.   Methods: This multicenter study enrolled patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve PBca and healthy participants. Optimized serum processing condition was evaluated with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization. The serum microRNA candidates were selected in disease association with Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA). A microRNA signature, combination of multiple serum microRNAs, was examined in exploratory, validation and independent validation set. Biology of the diagnostic miRNAs was evaluated using human pancreatic cancer cells.  Results: The 284 (healthy 150, PBca 134) of 827 serum samples were processed within 2hr of time-to serum collection, distributed at the same area of t-SNE map, assigned to exploratory set. The 193 optimized samples were assigned to validation (healthy 50, PBca 47) or independent validation set (healthy 50, PBca 46). Index-1 was a combination of the 5 serum microRNAs having disease-association on WGCNA, showed a sensitivity/specificity >80% and an AUC outperforming CA19-9 in exploratory, validation and independent validation set. The AUC of Index-1 for detecting T1 tumor was superior to CA19-9 (0.856 vs. 0.649, p = 0.038). Human pancreatic cancer cells had intra- and extracellular expression of miR-665, a component of Index-1. Transfection of miR-665 to a human pancreatic cancer cell inhibited cell growth.   Conclusions: A serum microRNA signature, Index-1, was useful for detecting PBca, which would improve the early diagnosis of PBca.\\nHomo sapiens\\nNon-coding RNA profiling by array\\n284 (healthy 150, PBca 134) serums were analyzed in the training set, and 93 serums were assigned to validation (healthy 50, PBca 47) or independent validation set (healthy 50, PBca 46).

However, beta cells response to chronic stress at a single cell level remains largely unknown. Here, we used a chemo-genetic model of beta cell excitotoxcity coupled with single cell RNA sequencing to understand beta cells response to chronic stress. Remarkably, we found that a subset of stressed beta cells progressed towards death while the other group evaded the destruction by dedifferentiation. Vulnerable beta cells that progressed towards death showed upregulation of genes implicated in apoptosis, inflammation and immune system activation. The resilient beta cells that evaded the stress showed increased expression aldh1a3, a canonical marker of mammalian beta cell dedifferentiation.\\nDanio rerio\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nWe used three different treatment groups for this study.

Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease.

We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain samples. We conducted RNA sequencing analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples and across ages in each sex. 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, especially in genes involved in complement system activation, suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes.

       " 'Epigenetic aging of seminal fluid is associated with inflammation\\nMale infertility has been a primary cause of global infertility, affecting 8-12% of couples worldwide. Previous studies have shown that semen quality decreases with advanced aging with an increased presence of inflammatory cells. In this study, we examined the DNA methylation of seminal fluid to understand how the methylome changes with age and infertility. We also compare the age associated changes in semen to those observed in buccal swabs in order to characterize differences in epigenetic aging across diverse tissues. We found that infertility associated changes in the DNA methylation of semen are driven by changes in cell composition, while those associated with aging are linked to inflammatory genes. Many age associated sites are demethylated with advanced aging and are associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways. By contrast, we do not observe age associated changes in inflammatory genes in buccal swab methylomes, which instead are characterized by changes to bivalent promoters. Our study suggests that DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker for male infertility assessment in addition to the standard semen analysis.\\nHomo sapiens\\nMethylation profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nTo examine the changes in DNA methylation of seminal fluids along with age and to compare across tissues, we collected semen and buccal samples from 83 individuals.

Recent surveys of zebrafish embryogenesis with single-cell transcriptomics have uncovered hundreds of cell types, but the dynamic accessible regions of the genome that determine regulatory programs responsible for the unique identity and function of each cell type during embryogenesis lack detailed study. Here, we present SPATAC-seq: a split-pool ligation-based high-throughput single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. Using SPATAC-seq, we profiled chromatin accessibility in more than 808,046 individual nuclei across 20 developmental stages spanning the sphere stage to the early larval protruding mouth stages in a single experiment. Using this chromatin accessibility map, we identified 604 cell types and inferred their developmental relationships. We also identified ï»¿959,040 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and delineate development-specific cCREs, as well as transcription factors defining diverse cell identities. Importantly, transient reporter assays confirmed that a majority of tested cCREs exhibited robust ï»¿enhanced EGFP expression in restricted cell types or tissues.

       " 'Age-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are more affected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging\\nEvaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity â\\x80\\x93 the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression (~4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes (~200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.\\nHomo sapiens\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nThe study involved 37 older patients with advancedâ\\x80\\x90stage, symptomatic knee/hip osteoarthritis (OP; median age 72 years and interquartile range [69â\\x80\\x9377] years, M:F = 5:32), 8 young patients with the same diagnosis (YP; 39 [37â\\x80\\x9342] years, M:F = 7:1), and 15 young healthy volunteers (YH; 35 [28â\\x80\\x9338] years, M:F = 13:2).

Here we show that MSL2 can regulate allele specific gene expression and we elucidate its mechanism of action. MSL2 is known to regulate gene dosage up to two fold in drosophila and mammals. In addition to its canonical role as a milder modulator, we found that the loss of MSL2 switches off gene expression completely in an allele specific way and results in biallelic to monoallelic gene expression, which will be ignored as classical down regulated genes without applying the mouse hybrid F1 system. It indicates that MSL2 can activate the expression of the allele which is otherwise inactive intrinsically. We further found this is achieved by the interplay between MSL and KANSL complex. MSL2 acts as a methylation-insensitive factor, which can prevent DNA methylation of the inactive allele, thus facilitating occupancy of methylation-sensitive factor KANSL3 and activating the gene expression. The novel mechanism of MSL2 provides a safeguarding system to warrant biallelic gene expression of intrinsically monoallelic expressed genes including X-inactivated and imprinting genes. These genes are further discovered as sex bias genes such as X-inactivation escaped genes (escapees) are expressed higher in females.

To circumvent these issues, here we generated 138,577 single cell expression profiles of human stem cell-derived microglia xenotransplanted in the brain of the AppNL-G-F model of amyloid pathology and wild type controls. Xenografted human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile similar to that seen in mouse microglia, but display a more pronounced HLA state, likely related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. The human microglial response also involves a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine CRM response to oligomeric AÎ²o. Genetic deletion of TREM2 or APOE, as well as APOE polymorphisms and TREM2R47H expression in the transplanted microglia modulate these responses differentially. The expression of other AD risk genes is differentially regulated across the distinct cell states elicited in response to amyloid pathology. Thus, we have identified multiple transcriptomic cell states adopted by human microglia in response to AD-related pathology, which should be taken into account in translational studies.\\nHomo sapiens\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nThe main goal of this project is to decipher the complex human microglial response towards amyloid aggregates.

       " 'The essential roles of FXR in diet and aging affected metabolic changes and liver disease development: a multi-omics study\\nAging and unhealthy diets are risks for metabolic diseases including liver cancer. Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases and progress into liver cancer as they age, and Western diet (WD) intake facilitates liver carcinogenesis in those mice. This study aimed to uncover molecular signatures within the gut-liver axis for diet and age-linked liver diseases in FXR-dependent or independent manners.Many more transcripts were changed due to WD intake and aging in WT mice than those in FXR KO mice. In other words, WD intake and aging impact the hepatic transcriptomes and metabolomes in an FXR-dependent manner. In WT mice, WD/aging upregulated inflammation-related genes and downregulated genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Urine metabolomes provided clear distinguishing for differential dietary intake. By contrast, the metabolomes of the liver, serum, or urine could reflect age differences. Further, irrespective of differential diets intake or ages, transcriptomes, metabolomes, and cecal microbiota distinguished WT and FXR KO. Western dietary patterns and aging share molecular commonality with FXR deactivation. Notably, WD, aging, and FXR deactivation commonly altered hepatic cell division-related transcripts (Cenpe, Ect2, Top2a, Kif20a, Tpx2, Nuf2, Kif18b, Aspm, E2f8, and Hmmr), which are associated with overall survival rate in HCC patients.

Briefly, in SPATAC-seq, (1) fixed nuclei are transposed in 48 different wells by 48 unique Tn5 transposase, which containing barcoded adaptors and 5'-phosphorylation; (2) the nuclei from all wells are collected and redistributed into second and third 48-well plate in turn, where the next two rounds of indexing are achieved through into either end of the custom transposome, which result in the generation of more than 110,000 (48^3) unique barcode combinations. (3) the nuclei are pooled, split into sublibraries and lysed, and the DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which introduce illumina sequencing barcodes and complete libraries construction. (4) After sequencing, fastq files were demultiplexed according to the same four-barcode combinations. For profiling more cells in one sublibrary, we can increase the number of barcode combinations by increase the number of indexing of each round to 96, which can produce about 1 million combinations. To assess the fidelity of SPATAC-seq, we performed a species-mixing experiment with cultured human (K562) and mouse (Hepa) cells.  Here, we tagged mixed permeabilized nuclei with only 8 barcoded transposome. In round 4, we generated eight sublibraries with different cell-recovery targets, which can be used to evaluating the stability of this method and the correlation between real doublet rates and theoretical value.\\nGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nWe firstly assembled 48 indexed Tn5 transposome complexes, and then performed a species-mixing experiment with cultured human (K562) and mouse (Hepa) cells to prove the feasibility of SPATAC-seq.

       " 'Characterization and analysis of the promoter region of Monodehydroascorbate reductase 4 (CpMDAR4) in papaya\\nThe aim of this research was to study the effects of cis-element differences between the X, Y and Yh alleles on the expression of CpMDAR4, a potential candidate gene for sex differentiation in papaya, using a transcriptional reporter system in a model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Possible effects of a retrotransposon insertion in the Y and Yh alleles on the transcription and expression of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers were also examined. When comparing promoters and cis-regulatory elements among genes in the non-recombining region of the sex chromosomes, paired genes exhibited differences. Our results showed that differences in the promoter sequences of the CpMDAR4 alleles drove the expression of a reporter gene to different flower tissues in Arabidopsis. Î²-glucuronidase staining analysis of T2 and T3 lines for constructs containing 5â\\x80\\x99 deletions of native Y and Yh allele promoters showed the loss of specific expression of the reporter gene in the anthers, confirming the existence and location of cis-regulatory element POLLEN1LELAT52. The expression analysis of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers also showed that all alleles are actively expressed in different flower tissues, with the existence of a shorter truncated isoform, with unknown function, for the Y and Yh alleles due to an LTR-RT insertion in the Y and Yh chromosomes. The observed expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers and the expression patterns of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers, suggest that MDAR4 might have a role on development of reproductive organs in papaya, and that it constitutes an important candidate for sex differentiation.\\nCarica papaya\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nTo evaluate tissue-specific expression of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers, total RNA was extracted from small flower buds (< 1 mm), reproductive organs of pre-meiotic (1-6 mm) and post-meiotic (7-12 mm) flower buds (including aborted pistils or â\\x80\\x9cpistillodeâ\\x80\\x9d), mature flowers (15-20 mm) and gametophytes of mature â\\x80\\x98AU9â\\x80\\x99 female flowers and â\\x80\\x98AU9â\\x80\\x99 male flowers.',\n",

       " 'Metabolic competition between lipid metabolism and histone methylation regulates sexual differentiation in human malaria parasites\\nLike most pathogens, malaria parasites balance persistence in the current host with transmission to the next. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent human malaria parasite, persistence depends on continuous asexual replication in red blood cells while transmission requires differentiation into non-replicating gametocytes, the male and female cells able to infect the mosquito vector. This developmental decision is controlled via stochastic derepression of a heterochromatin-silenced locus encoding the transcription factor PfAP2-G, which acts as the master switch for sexual differentiation. Recent work showed that the frequency of pfap2-g derepression is responsive to extracellular levels of phospholipid precursors. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking these metabolites to epigenetic regulation of pfap2-g was hitherto unknown. Using chemical, metabolomic, and genetic approaches, we show that this response is mediated by metabolic competition for the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine between histone methyltransferases and phospho-ethanolamine methyltransferase, a critical enzyme in the parasiteâ\\x80\\x99s pathway for de novo phosphatidyl-choline synthesis. When phosphatidyl-choline precursors are scarce, increased consumption of S-adenosylmethionine for de novo synthesis of phosphatidyl-choline results in a decrease in histone methylation marks that mediate silencing of pfap2-g, thereby up-regulating its transcription and increasing the frequency of sexual differentiation. Our findings reveal a key connection between metabolite utilization and gene expression in malaria parasites that forms the mechanistic link between phosphatidyl-choline metabolism and the frequency of sexual commitment.\\nPlasmodium falciparum\\nGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nWe performed Cut&RUN for H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 on P. falciparum nuclei under different growth media conditions',\n",

These proteins also silenced many other genes with different efficacy, and a machine learning model could accurately predict the efficacy of each silencer based on various chromatin features of the target loci. Furthermore, some proteins were also able to target gene silencing when used in a dCas9-SunTag system. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulatory pathways in plants and provide an armament of tools for targeted gene manipulation.\\nArabidopsis thaliana\\nGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingExpression profiling by high throughput sequencingMethylation profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nThis dataset includes ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and BS-PCR to understand the molecular mechanism of Arabidopsis ZF targeting proteins.',\n",

       " 'Circadian alignment of early onset caloric restriction promotes longevity in male C57BL/6J mice\\nCaloric restriction (CR) prolongs lifespan, yet the mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. Under CR, mice self-impose chronic cycles of 2-hour-feeding and 22-hour-fasting, raising the question whether calories, fasting, or time of day are causal. We show that 30%-CR is sufficient to extend lifespan 10%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian-alignment of feeding act together to extend lifespan 35% in male C57BL/6J mice. These circadian effects of CR are independent of fasting duration and body weight. Aging induces widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad lib fed mice. CR at night ameliorates these aging-related changes. Thus, circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging.\\nMus musculus\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nmRNA-seq circadian profiles generated for C57BL/6J male mice fed under 6 different feeding conditions and collected at 6 and 19 months of age.

Yet, to what extent 5hmC participates in genome-wide methylation reprogramming remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the 5hmC landscapes in mouse early embryos and germ cells with parental allele specificity. DNA hydroxymethylation was most strongly correlated with DNA demethylation as compared with de novo or maintenance methylation in zygotes, while 5hmC was targeted to particular de novo methylated sites in postimplantation epiblasts. Surprisingly, DNA replication was also required for 5hmC generation, especially in the female pronucleus. More strikingly, aberrant nuclear localization of Dnmt1/Uhrf1 in mouse zygotes due to maternal deficiency of Nlrp14 led to defects in DNA-replication-coupled passive demethylation and impaired 5hmC deposition, revealing the divergency between genome-wide 5-methylcytosine (5mC) maintenance and Tet-mediated oxidation.

       " 'Inflammation of the Aged Bone Marrow Niche Drives Blood Aging\\nHematopoietic aging is defined by a loss of regenerative capacity and skewed differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) leading to dysfunctional blood production. Signals from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment dynamically tailor hematopoiesis, but the effect of aging on the niche and the contribution of the aging niche to blood aging still remains unclear. Here, we show the development of an inflammatory milieu in the aged marrow cavity, which drives both niche and hematopoietic system remodeling. We find decreased numbers and functionality of osteogenic endosteal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), expansion of pro-inflammatory perisinusoidal MSCs, and deterioration of the central marrow sinusoidal endothelium, which together create a self-reinforcing inflamed BM milieu. Single cell molecular mapping of old niche cells further confirms disruption of cell identities and enrichment of inflammatory response genes. Inflammation, in turn, drives chronic activation of emergency myelopoiesis pathways in old HSCs and multipotent progenitors, which promotes myeloid differentiation at the expense of lymphoid and erythroid commitment, and hinders hematopoietic regeneration. Remarkably, both defective hematopoietic regeneration, niche deterioration and HSC aging can be improved by blocking inflammatory IL-1 signaling. Our results indicate that targeting the pro-inflammatory niche milieu can be instrumental in restoring blood production during aging.\\nMus musculus\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nRNA sequencing of mesenchymal and endothelial populations isolated from both endosteum and central marrow of young and old mice',\n",

We conducted a comprehensive miRNA expression analysis of serum samples from 1348 Japanese dementia patients, composed of four subtypesâ\\x80\\x94Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease (AD), vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and normal pressure hydrocephalusâ\\x80\\x94and 246 control subjects. We used this data to construct dementia subtype prediction models based on penalized regression models with the multiclass classification. We constructed a final prediction model using 46 miRNAs, which classified dementia patients from an independent validation set into four subtypes of dementia. Network analysis of miRNA target genes revealed important hub genes, SRC and CHD3, associated with the AD pathogenesis. Moreover, MCU and CASP3, which are known to be associated with DLB pathogenesis, were identified from our DLB-specific target genes. Our study demonstrates the potential of blood-based biomarkers for use in dementia-subtype prediction models.

       " 'Non-coding RNAs shape cortical neurons developmental trajectories\\nA hallmark of cortical evolution is the high dynamic subventricular zone (SVZ) expansion, where basal progenitors (BPs) amplify and neuronal transcriptional programs unfold. How non-coding molecular factors such as microRNAs influence these developmental trajectories and regulate the acquisition of cortical type identities is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that miR-137 and miR-122 regulate the positioning and identity features of superficial layer cortical neurons by acting at distinct steps of their developmental trajectories. MiR-137 sustains basal progenitor amplification by reverting their neurogenic commitment and inducing high proliferative state upregulating Cd63 and inhibiting Myt1l. Cd63 is an extra-cellular matrix (ECM) receptor which interacts with ï\\x81¡ï\\x81®b3- and ï\\x81¢1-integrin pathways to promote proliferation, while Myt1l is a transcription factor that promotes and sustains neuronal fate. The BPs amplification by miR-137 is converted in the promotion of intracortical projecting neuron (ICPN) identity and L2/3 expansion. As opposed to miR-137, miR-122 acts postmitotically, affecting the bioelectrical properties, the calcium and cytoskeleton dynamics of newborn neurons as well as their transcriptional program, leading to a persistent molecular immaturity across time. Overall, these findings reveal that miR-137 and miR-122 are key regulators of the developmental trajectory of cortical neurons across evolution.\\nMus musculus\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nInvestigation of the non-coding RNAs miR-122 and miR-137 overexpression on progenitor and neuron transcriptional programs.   psil-miR122, psil-miR137 or psil-scramble (control) plasmids were in utero electroporated together with pUB-GFP or pUB-Tomato plasmid in mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 14.5, and cells collected at E15.5, E17.5 or postnatal day (P) 7 using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

       " \"Transcriptional and imprinting complexity in Arabidopsis seeds at single-nucleus resolution\\nSeeds are the basis of agriculture, yet their full transcriptional complexity has remained unknown. Here, we employ single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, with a focus on endosperm. Endosperm, the site of gene imprinting in plants, mediates the relationship between the maternal parent and embryo. We identify new cell types in the chalazal endosperm region, which interfaces with maternal tissue for nutrient unloading. We further demonstrate that the extent of parental bias of maternally expressed imprinted genes varies with cell cycle phase, and that imprinting of paternally expressed imprinted genes is strongest in chalazal endosperm. These data indicate imprinting in endosperm is heterogeneous and suggest that parental conflict, which is proposed to drive the evolution of imprinting, is fiercest at the boundary between filial and maternal tissues.\\nArabidopsis thaliana\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nTo identify cell/nuclei types and investigate imprinting dynamics within endosperm, single nucleus RNA-seq was performed using the Smart-seq2 method on seed nuclei, targeting either the 3C or 6C FANS peak in order to enrich for triploid endosperm (other seed tissues are diploid). A total of 1,664 libraries were sequenced, of which 64 were negative controls (no DNA in library prep or no cell sorted), 51 were made from two nuclei to test single-nuclei sorting accuracy, 112 failed QC checks (< 1,500 genes detected and/or <1,000 detected with 5+ reads), and the remaining 1,437 were high-quality single-nuclei libraries used in final analysis.

Although computational approaches have been developed to integrate single-cell datasets, their efficacy still needs to be determined with reference to authentic single-cell multi-omic profiles. To address this challenge, we devised single-nucleus methylCytosine, Chromatin accessibility and Transcriptome sequencing (snmC2T-seq) and applied the approach to post-mortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a computational framework to evaluate the quality of finely defined cell types using multi-modal information and validated the efficacy of computational multi-omic integration methods. Correlation analysis in individual cells revealed gene groups showing distinct relations between methylation and expression. Integration of snmC2T-seq with other multi- and single- modal datasets enabled joint analyses of the methylome, chromatin accessibility, transcriptome, and chromatin architecture for 63 human cortical cell types. We reconstructed the regulatory lineage of these cortical cell types and found pronounced cell-type-specific enrichment of disease risks for neuropsychiatric traits, predicting causal cell types that can be targeted for treatment.\\nHomo sapiens\\nGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingMethylation profiling by high throughput sequencingExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nsnmC2T-seq and snATAC-seq',\n",

       " 'Effects of losmapimod on antigen-specific response in aged skin\\nOlder humans are more susceptible to infections, even those to which they were immune to in their youth. Vaccination against many different infectious agents is also sub-optimal in these individuals. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the decline in immunity during ageing we inject safe derivatives of microorganisms into the skin of old and young volunteers.  After injection of the agent, we can extract the white cells (leucocytes) that accumulate at the site of the immune response to test for their function.  One of the responses we have been investigating is that to the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that induces chickenpox mainly in young individuals. Infected subjects control this persistent virus until an older age where reduced immunity leads to viral re-activation to cause shingles.  We have found that this defective response is associated with increased baseline inflammation in this tissue. Although inflammatory responses are required to clear infections, excessive inflammation has previously been shown to interfere with the generation of specific immunity.  We will therefore investigate ways of enhancing the immune response of older humans by blocking basal inflammation.     To extend our initial observations of high background inflammation in the skin, we will investigate which cells in this tissue are responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators by using a second human experimental system that tests the response to a skin irritant known as cantharadin. Next we will block inflammation in the skin to determine whether this can lead to improved responses upon challenge with antigens. This will be achieved by pre-treating old subjects with a drug that has already been developed by GSK (Losmapimod, p38MAPkinase inhibitor) and another that is available off the shelf (vitamin D3). The GSK p38 inhibitors are currently being tested to prevent unwanted inflammation. A surprising observation we made was that p38 inhibition could also rejuvenate human T lymphocytes and enhance their ability to proliferate in vitro. Therefore the inhibition of p38 may block unwanted inflammatory response as well as enhance T lymphocyte reactivity. Vitamin D3 has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and works in part by inhibiting p38MAPkinase activation. The use of 2 separate interventions in this project increases the likelihood of success in this study. While Losmapimod may be more specific in its anti-inflammatory action, the use of vitamin D3 is more cost effective as it is a cheap compound that is readily available.     The desirable outcome of this study is that either one or other of these compounds, that older volunteers will be treated with, will boost their response to microbial antigen challenge in the skin. This will provide proof of concept data that will lead to the exciting possibility of enhancing immunity by inhibiting the increased baseline inflammatory responses that are found during ageing. This may be a strategy to enhance immune responses in general and specifically to enhance vaccination efficacy to various diseases that is less effective in older subjects.\\nHomo sapiens\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nA total of 126 samples were analysed, including normal skin (n=30), saline (6 hour; n=30), VZV (6 hour; n=32), and VZV (day2; n=34).',\n",

We carried out longitudinal within-subject studies in male and female psychiatric patients to identify blood gene expression biomarkers that track short term memory as measured by the retention measure in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. These biomarkers were prioritized with a convergent functional genomics approach using previous evidence in the field  implicating them in Alzheimer Disease. The top candidate biomarkers were tested in an independent cohort for ability to predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairment\\nHomo sapiens\\nExpression profiling by array\\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a clear and present danger to older adults, and has a profound socio-economic impact (refs). Existing therapies are limited in efficacy (refs). Early identification of individuals at risk may open the door to preventive approaches.  Short-term memory dysfunction is a key early feature of AD. We proposed to identify blood biomarkers that track a relevant related quantitative phenotype for short-term memory, the retention measure of recall in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) (Figure S1).  Previous work by our group has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track suicidal ideation using longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) (Le-Niculescu et al.

Those biomarkers were also useful in pharmacogenomic and drug repurposing analyses. We endeavored to use a similar approach to identify biomarkers for short-term memory.  We conducted our longitudinal studies in psychiatric disorder subjects, a population enriched in memory retention abnormalities, and which  may be at increased risk of AD and other aging-related disorders, due to the effects  of stress and depression (Nho et al. 2015, Rangaraju et al. 2016, al refs).

This work elucidates the mutual spatiotemporal relationships between different epicardial subpopulations and assigns unique function to each during cardiac development.

       " 'Discovery and characterization of variance QTLs in human induced pluripotent stem cells\\nQuantification of gene expression levels at the single cell level has revealed that gene expression can vary substantially even across a population of homogeneous cells. However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 241 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 82% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 14 vQTLs at 10% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs), which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean, have systematically smaller effect sizes than eQTLs. We estimate that at least 300 cells per individual and 400 individuals would be required to have modest power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.\\nHomo sapiens\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencingOther\\nThe goal of our study was to identify quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression variance across cells (vQTLs).

We used unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to tag RNA molecules and account for amplification bias in the single cell data (Islam et al., 2014). To estimate technical confounding effects without requiring separate technical replicates, we used a mixed-individual plate study design. The key idea of this approach is that having observations from the same individual under different confounding effects and observations from different individuals under the same confounding effect allows us to distinguish the two sources of variation (Tung et al., 2017).',\n",

Bulk transcriptomics on blood samples are difficult to interpret because the blood is composed of different cell types that may react differently to virus infection. Dengue virus RNA can be detected in human plasma, however identifying the cells carrying dengue virus through the bloodstream in vivo has proven challenging. Here we used our recently developed viscRNA-Seq approach to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single blood peripheral mononuclear cells from 6 human subjects with dengue fever and severe dengue, as well as to characterize the cell types associated with dengue virus in the human blood. We found that although no bulk transcriptome marker for severe dengue exists, the expression of MX2 in naive B cells, of CD163 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes and of other genes in specific cell types is highly predictive for severe dengue. We detected virus-associated cells in the blood of two severe dengue patients with high viral load and discovered the majority of these to be B cells expressing germline IgM or IgD immunoglobulin chains and naive markers but also showing signs of activation and expression of CD69, CXCR4, and other surface receptors. In bystander B cells we detected signs of strong immune activation, parallel hypersomatic evolution and, in one severe degue subject, an anomalously large clone of highly mutated, IgG1 plasmablasts that could be reactive to dengue virus.

       " \"miRNA and colorectal cancer:  associations with tumor phenotype and survival\\nMicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs.  Data suggest the importance of miRNAs to cancer development and possibly to survival.  Our overall hypothesis is that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses.  While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and  to survival.  We have analyzed the expression of 2006 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from:  1975 people with incident colon cancer or rectal cancer and 290 polyps from colon and rectal cases (included in this study) who reported a prior polyp.  MiRNA was obtained from dissected paraffin-embedded tissue and assessed using an Agilent microarray platform.  We intend to extend our validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype (TP53, KRAS2, CIMP+, and for colon tumors MSI+), inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival.  We will identify associations with miRNAs that are related to specific molecular phenotypes, with drivers in the carcinogenic process, and with clinical features and survival.  These miRNAs will be validated using targeted Agilent Platform. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models.  Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals.  MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment as well as provide support that miRNAs function as the â\\x80\\x9cdriverâ\\x80\\x9d in the carcinogenic process.  Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function.  Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 1975 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases in the most cost-efficient manner possible. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment.MiRNAs are small, non-protein-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression either by post-transcriptionally suppressing mRNA translation or by mRNA degradation.  We examine differentially expressed miRNAs in colorectal carcinomas, adenomas, and normal colonic mucosa. Data come from population-based studies of colorectal cancer conducted in Utah and the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program.  A total of 1893 carcinoma/normal paired samples and 290 adenoma tissue samples were run on the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V19.0 which contained 2006 miRNAs.  We tested for significant differences in miRNA expression between paired carcinoma/adenoma/normal colonic tissue samples.  Fewer than 600 miRNAs were expressed in >80% of people for colonic tissue; of these 86.5% were statistically differentially expressed between carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa using a False Discovery Rate of 0.05.  Roughly half of these differentially expressed miRNAs showed a progression in levels of expression from normal to adenoma to carcinoma tissue.  Other miRNAs appeared to be altered at the normal to adenoma stage, while others were only altered at the adenoma to carcinoma stage or only at the normal to carcinoma stage.    Evaluation of the Agilent platform showed a high degree of repeatability (r=0.98) and reasonable agreement with the NanoString platform.

       " 'The biological age linked with oxidative estress modifies breast cancer aggressiveness\\nThe incidence of breast cancer increases with age until menopause, and breast cancer is more aggressive in younger women. The existence of epidemiological links between breast cancer and aging indicates that both processes possibly share some common mechanisms of development. Oxidative stress is associated with both cancer susceptibility and aging. Here we observed that ERBB2-positive breast cancer, developed from genetically different ERBB2-positive transgenic mice generated by a backcross, is more aggressive in younger than in older mice, similar to what occurs in humans. In this cohort, we estimated the oxidative biological age using a mathematical model that integrated several subphenotypes directly or indirectly related to oxidative stress. This model included the serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and magnesium that were determined at a disease-free stage, and total AKT1 and glutathione concentrations in the liver at the time of necropsy. Later we defined the grade of aging due to oxidative stress as the increment of aging, which was the difference between the predicted biological age and the chronological age. This comparison permitted the identification of the biologically younger mice with less oxidative stress and older mice with more oxidative stress than would be expected according to their chronological age. Interestingly, biologically older mice developed more aggressive breast cancer than the biologically younger mice. We identified genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 15 that were linked to the grade of oxidative aging. The levels of expression of Zbp1 located on chromosome 2, a gene related to necroptosis and inflammation, positively correlated with the grade of oxidative aging and tumour aggressiveness. This study shows part of the complex interactions between breast cancer and aging.\\nExpression profiling by array\\nWe have studied differential gene expression from livers in mice with different susceptibility with breast cancer.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the epigenetically distinct neuronal classes is currently missing. Cytosine DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes neuron types and marks gene regulatory elements. We developed an efficient single-nucleus methylome sequencing approach that allows robust high-throughput neuron-type classification. We generated >6,000 single-nucleus methylomes and identified 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulations in the frontal cortex. Both CG and non-CG methylation exhibited cell type-specific distributions that recapitulate and extend findings from single neuron transcriptome profiling. Moreover, we found approximately 500,000 neuron-type-specific regulatory elements showing strong differential methylation in mouse and human cortex. Distinct methylation signatures identified an unique human Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory sub-type and a layer 6 specific excitatory sub-type in mouse. Comparative epigenomic analysis showed stronger conservation of gene regulatory elements in inhibitory compared with excitatory neurons. These findings demonstrate the utility of single nucleus methylome profiling for both expanding the atlas of brain cell types and identifying regulatory elements that potentially drive these differences.\\nMethylation profiling by high throughput sequencingOther\\nSingle Cell Methylome analysis of mouse and human frontal cortex',\n",

Enigmatically, plants induce similar transcriptome responses upon infection by virulent or avirulent pathogens. This renders the importance of transcriptional reprogramming for immunity obscure. Here, using RNA-seq, we generate time-series transcriptome data coupled with genetic perturbations to reveal temporal dynamics upon infection by virulent or avirulent strains of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Fast and sustained transcriptional reprogramming occurs upon infection with avirulent strains while virulent strain infection leads to a slower response with comparable gene expression patterns and magnitudes. Importantly, transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible mutants responding to avirulent strains links delayed transcriptional reprogramming to compromised immunity. Taken together, our results pinpoint the early critical time window of transcriptional reprogramming for establishing effective immunity against the bacterial pathogen.\\nArabidopsis thaliana\\nExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nLeaves of Col-0 and all the single, double, triple and quadruple mutants of dde2-2, ein2-1, pad4-1, sid2-2 were syringe-infiltrated with mock (water) or suspensions of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto DC3000) carrying an empty vector (pLAFR), Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2, or Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpm1 at the OD600 of 0.001.

M82), S. pennellii (LA0716), and 75 introgression lines between those parents were grown according to (Ron et al., 2013). Plates were placed vertically in a rack in a randomized block design and the experiments were carried out in a growth chamber with a 16:8 light:dark cycle at 22ÂºC and 50-75% humidity with a light intensity of 100Î¼E. The germination date was monitored for each seed. Immediately prior to harvesting root tissue for RNA-seq, each replicate of each genotype had between 2 and 5 plates, all of which were scanned with a Epson Perfection V700 photo flatbed scanner into 24-bit RGB TIF image files at 300 dpi. Images were analyzed with the imageJ program (Rasband 1997-2014) and custom macros. Based on germination date and scan date, seedling age in days after germination was determined, and primary roots of seedlings that were 3 or 4 days post-germination were traced with the imageJ polyline tool, following the root centerline from the top of the root (at start of hairs and change from green to white) to the tip. The coordinates of the polylines were recorded by the macros in data tables saved as files, along with metadata including genotype, plate ID, plating date, germination day of each seedling, plate harvest date, measurer, and two flags for each root: â\\x80\\x9ccollideâ\\x80\\x9d was true if the root contacted or crossed another root, and â\\x80\\x9calongâ\\x80\\x9d was true if the root contacted another root and grew along it for any distance.

The CTD in mammals is composed of 52 heptad-repeats with the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Repeats in the distal part of CTD deviate from the consensus sequence and have frequently replaced serine at position 7 by lysine residues (K7). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed modification of K7 residues in heptad-repeats 39, 42, and 47/49 by acetylation and in heptad-repeats 38, 39, 40, 42, and 47/49 by mono-, di-, or trimethylation. Notably, acetylated as well as di- and tri-methylated K7 residues were found exclusively in phosphorylated CTD peptides, while mono-methylated K7 residues occurred also in non-phosphorylated CTD peptides. Methylation of K7 residues was further studied with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1F5, which recognizes mono- and di-methylated K7 in CTD. ChIP experiments revealed high levels of K7 methylation at the transcriptional start site of genes. The low levels of K7 methylation in the body of genes results from impairment of epitope recognition in hyper-phosphorylated CTD by mAb 1F5. In agreement with this notion, phosphatase treatment of hyper-phosphorylated CTD or treatment of cells with kinase inhibitor flavopiridol restored the reactivity of mAb 1F5 towards methylated K7 residues in CTD. We conclude that methylation and acetylation of K7 residues further expand the mammalian CTD code and potentially contribute to regulation of gene expression.\\nHomo sapiens\\nGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nThis study was performed in a human Raji cell line.

It has long been postulated that epigenetics plays a key role in these processes, but with one or two exceptions, solid evidence for the role of epigenetic variation in these processes is lacking. A key impediment to understanding these processes is the lack of information on the extent of epigenetic variation and how it relates to genetic and phenotypic variation in natural population, both over the lifecycle of an individual, and over evolutionary time. Here we show that genetic variants under selection in the north of Sweden appear to drive variation in DNA methylation, which in turn is highly correlated with local climate. Selective sweeps and genetic variants associated with adaptation to the local environment have previously been identified within the Swedish Arabidopsis population. Our finding that they harbour variants responsible for climate associated epigenetic variation strongly supports the role of epigenetic processes in local adaptation.

       " 'Effects of Changes in Food Supply at the Time of Sex Differentiation on the Gonadal Transcriptome of Juvenile Fish. Implications for Natural and Farmed Populations\\nBackground: Food supply is a major factor influencing growth rates in animals. This has important implications for both natural and farmed fish populations, since food restriction may difficult reproduction. However, a study on the effects of food supply on the development of juvenile gonads has never been transcriptionally described in fish.Methods and Findings: This study investigated the consequences of growth on gonadal transcriptome of European sea bass in: 1) 4-month-old sexually undifferentiated fish, comparing the gonads of fish with the highest vs. the lowest growth, to explore a possible link between transcriptome and future sex, and 2) testis from 11-month-old juveniles where growth had been manipulated through changes in food supply. The four groups used were: i) sustained fast growth, ii) sustained slow growth, iii) accelerated growth, iv) decelerated growth. The transcriptome of undifferentiated gonads was not drastically affected by initial natural differences in growth. Further, changes in the expression of genes associated with protein turnover were seen, favoring catabolism in slow-growing fish and anabolism in fast-growing fish. Moreover, while fast-growing fish took energy from glucose, as deduced from the pathways affected and the analysis of protein-protein interactions examined, in slow-growing fish lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis was favored. Interestingly, the highest transcriptomic differences were found when forcing initially fast-growing fish to decelerate their growth, while accelerating growth of initially slow-growing fish resulted in full transcriptomic convergence with sustained fast-growing fish.Conclusions: Food availability during sex differentiation shapes the juvenile testis transcriptome, as evidenced by adaptations to different energy balances. Remarkably, this occurs in absence of major histological changes in the testis.Thus, fish are able to recover transcriptionally their testes if they are provided with enough food supply during sex differentiation; however, an initial fast growth does not represent any advantage in terms of transcriptional fitness if later food becomes scarce.\\nDicentrarchus labrax\\nExpression profiling by array\\nWhole gonad transcriptome analysis from 35 individuals.

While  DNA  methylation dynamics  have already been implicated during  neurodevelopment, little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here we report DNA hydroxymethylation dynamics during  cerebellum development in  the  human brain.  Overall, we find a positive correlation  between 5-hmC levels and cerebellum development. Genome-wide profiling reveals that 5-hmC is highly enriched  on specific gene regions, including  exons and especially the  untranslated regions (UTRs), but it is depleted on introns and intergenic regions. Furthermore, we have identified fetus-specific and adult-specific differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlap with genes and  CpG island shores. Surprisingly, during development DhMRs are highly enriched in genes encoding mRNAs that can be regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), some of which are disrupted in autism, as well as in many known autism genes. Our results suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic regulation  may  broadly impact the development of  the  human brain, and  its dysregulation could  contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.\\nHomo sapiens\\nMethylation profiling by high throughput sequencing\\nWe generated comprehensive genome-wide profiles of 5hmC in human cerebellum.',\n",

We ran four CNV calling algorithms and analyzed rare large CNVs (>100 Kb) to obtain high-confidence calls that were detected by at least two algorithms. In total, 734 such CNVs were observed in our dataset. Global burden analyses did not reveal significant differences between cases and controls in CNV rate, distribution of deletions or duplications, total or average CNV size; and number of genes affected by CNVs.

       " 'A DNA Methylation Fingerprint of  1,628 Human Samples\\nDNA methylation is the best characterized of the different layers that make up the epigenetic setting. Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation patterns have been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of human samples and pathological conditions. The recently arrived single-base-resolution technologies for DNA methylation are extremely helpful tools, but are not yet applicable and affordable for studying large groups of subjects. Herein, we present a compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation fingerprint of 1,628 human samples where we interrogated 1,505 CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and stemness, particularly around transcription start sites that are not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA methylation fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human cancer cells underwent a progressive gain of promoter CpG island hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG island promoters. Although transformed cells are those where DNA methylation disruption is more obvious, we observed that other common human diseases, such as neurological and autoimmune disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation profiles. Most importantly, we provide proof of principle that the obtained DNA methylation fingerprints might be useful for translational purposes by showing that are able to identify the tumor type origin of Cancers of Unknown Primary (CUPs). Thus, the DNA methylation patterns identified across the largest spectrum of samples, tissues and diseases reported to date constitute a baseline for developing higher-resolution DNA methylation maps, and provide important clues concerning the contribution of CpG methylation to tissue identity and its changes in the most prevalent human diseases.\\nHomo sapiens\\nMethylation profiling by array\\nIt was studied the genomic DNA from 1,628 human samples corresponding to 424 normal tissues (180 leukocytes, 97 colon mucosa and 227 other normal samples), 1,054 tumorigenic samples (premalignant lesions, primary tumors and metastases) and 150 non-cancerous disorders, such as brain lesions from Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, aortic atherosclerotic lesions, myopathies and autoimmune disorders.',\n",
       " 'Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying mRNA isoform regulation\\nThrough alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that may have distinct or even antagonistic functions. To infer isoform regulation based on data from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-Seq), we have developed MISO, a computational model that estimates the expression level of alternatively spliced exons and mRNA isoforms and provides intuitive measures of conï¬\\x81dence in these estimates. Incorporation of the length distribution of inserted cDNA fragments in paired-end RNA-Seq analysis in MISO enables dramatic improvements in estimation of alternative splicing levels relative to previous methods. We show that one lane of paired-end RNA-Seq data can provide far more information about splicing than two lanes of single-end data, depending critically on properties of the distribution of cDNA fragment lengths in the sequenced library. MISO also leads to an intuitive method to detect diï¬\\x80erentially regulated exons  or isoforms. Application of this method implicates the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H in regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that is supported by UV  crosslinking/immunoprecipitation/high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) analysis.

Elongating polymerases tend to pause near both coding ends immediately upstream of the epigenetic peaks, causing a significant reduction in elongation efficiency, suggesting their role in control of RNA splicing. Conserved features in underlying protein coding sequences seem to dictate their evolutionary conservation across multiple species.

       " \"Transcriptional profiles of rodent hippocampal CA1 tissue during aging and cognitive decline\\nRecent microarray studies in the hippocampus of rodents or Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease (AD) subjects have identified a substantial number of cellular pathways/processes correlated with aging and cognitive decline. However, the temporal relationships among these expression changes or with cognitive impairment have not been studied in depth.  Here, using Affymetrix microarrays, immunohistochemistry and Morris water maze cognitive testing across 5 age groups of male F344 rats (n=9-15/group, one microarray per animal), we systematically analyzed the temporal sequence and cellular localization of aging changes in expression.  These were correlated with performance scores on the hippocampus-dependent Morris Water Maze task. Significant microarray results were sorted in to Early, Intermediate, Midlife, and Late patterns of expression, and functionally categorized (Early- downregulated neural development, lipid synthesis and energy-utilization; upregulated ribosomal synthesis, growth, stress/inflammatory, lysosome and protein/lipid degradation. Intermediate- increased defense/inflammatory activation and decreased transporter activity; Midlife- downregulated energy-dependent signaling and neurite growth, upregulated astroglial activation, Ca2+-binding, cholesterol/lipid trafficking, myelinogenic processes and additional lysosome/inflammation; Late- further recruitment of genes in already-altered pathways). Immunohistochemistry revealed a primarily astrocytic localization of the processes upregulated in midlife, as well as increased density of myelin proteins. Evidence of cognitive impairment first appeared in the 12-month-old group (midlife) and was increased further in the 23-month-old group, exhibiting the highest correlations with some upregulated genes related to cholesterol transport (e.g., Apoe, Abca2), protein management and ion binding. Some upregulated genes for inflammation (Il6st) and myelinogenesis (Pmp22) also correlated with impairment. Together, the data are consistent with a novel sequential cascade model of brain aging in which metabolic alterations early in maturity are followed by inflammation and midlife activation of an astrocyte-centered cholesterol trafficking pathway that stimulates oligodendrocyte remyelination programs. Importantly, this cholesterol trafficking pathway also may compete for astroglial bioenergetic support of neurons, in turn, leading to downregulation of energy-dependent pathways needed to sustain cognitive functions.Keywords: aging time course\\nRattus norvegicus\\nExpression profiling by array\\nFisher 344 rats aged 3 (n = 9), 6 (n = 9), 9 (n = 9), 12 (n = 9), or 25 (n = 15; but see below) months were behaviorally characterized on the Morris water maze. Briefly, animals were placed in a circular water bath chamber with a partially submerged platform. Three times per day for three days, animals were placed at randomized starting points with the goal of locating the hidden platform. Generally, animals became better at locating the platform, and by the third day of training, were reliably swimming directly to the platform despite randomized starting loci. On the fourth day, the platform was removed and the degree to which the animals focused their searches on the area that previously contained the platform was measured. On the last day of behavior, animals were given a cue trial in which the platform was raised above the water level so that the rats could see it. Measures taken from the behavior study included path length (how long did the animal swim prior to locating the platform/ platform area), latency to platform in seconds, and velocity (centimeters/ second; swim speed). Two aged animals (E2 and E12) were removed from the study for poor health, reducing the 23 month cohort (n = 13). Twelve to twenty four hours after the last behavioral session, animals were killed and their hippocampi removed. The right hippocampus went to immunohistochemistry for quantification and localization of selected protein products. The left hippocampus was dissected, the CA1 region removed and frozen in dry ice prior to microarray processing. mRNA was extracted from each animal's tissue by standard Affymetrix protocols (see Blalock et al., 2003) and hybridized to individual microarrays (RAE 230A; N = 49 arrays in total). Results were processed with the MAS5 algorithm and subjected to â\\x80\\x98all probe setâ\\x80\\x99 scaling with a target intensity of 500. Probe sets were filtered for presence (> = 5 presence calls study wide) and gene symbol level annotation prior to statistical analysis. 1-ANOVA across age was used to identify aging-related probe sets/genes (p <= 0.05). Aging-related genes were subjected to post hoc template correlation to determine the pattern of age-related change, and further, within the 12 and 23 month old groups, Pearson's correlation with behavioral scores was used to identify genes whose expression levels correlated significantly (p <= 0.05) with behavior. Twelve and 23 month old groups were chosen for this correlation analysis as they showed the greatest variability among similarly aged animals, suggesting that these ages show important cognitive transition phases during aging-related cognitive decline. Functional grouping analysis was performed using the DAVID suite of on-line tools.\",\n",
